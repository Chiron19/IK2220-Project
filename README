## How to run the project

For single test, run `make app` in a terminal first, then run `make topo` in another terminal.

For batch test, run `make test` in a terminal directly, result logs would appear in the "result" directory. After finishing, run `make report` manually to concentrate the output files into a single report.

If encountering "controller is currently running" or other problems, close all terminals and run `make clean`. It will kill all processes and remove file linkings and Python cache files, except for results or report.

**make topo:**

Starts mininet topology


**make app:**

Starts the controller.
The default pox directory is set to '/opt/pox/'.
However one should be able to overwrite it using make input.

Example:
`$ make poxdir=/pox/base/directory/ app`

**make test:**

Restarts topology, and the sdn controller. Then it runs provided test scenarios.

**make clean:**

Removes all junks added to different directories to run the application.

**make report:**

Generate report with output files automatically.
